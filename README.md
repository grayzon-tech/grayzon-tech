### About

I'm a solo developer designing thoughtful tools for modern workflows. I focus on clear interfaces, useful experiences, and maintainable systems. I prefer shipping over perfection and iteration over assumption.

Currently building projects around:

- Digital workspace tools
- Lightweight web utilities
- UI/UX systems with strong design principles

I work end-to-end — from idea to UI to deployment.
